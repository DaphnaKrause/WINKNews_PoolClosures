# WINKNews_PoolClosures
Pool Closed in Lee County 2018-19

##This Repository outlines an Interactive Map made with Leaflet

The original data set was taken from this Florida health site: [www.floridahealth.gov](http://www.floridahealth.gov/statistics-and-data/eh-tracking-and-reporting/swimming-pools.html?appSession=9G992R3P228M7S400D2NS63M277CY3UH4O7PXK7TED4EUU27280E18N3ZNOA02623098DYZ26TPU190566S2L14T04I8YLIPJ7VHBQJVV40WFC8JS1TE94SL68O19TYY)

I Geocoded the Lat/Long location for the Pool Closure Map using [Texas A&M's free services](https://geoservices.tamu.edu/), writing a similar script to the [WINKNews_BusStopMap](https://github.com/DaphnaKrause/WINKNews_BusStopMap)

This repo includes:

1. one HTML page
2. CSS
3. JS including a JSON file
4. Images- for the background and marker
5. CSV of Pool Data that I used for the JSON file
